-------------- Installation --------------
You will need to build the lp_solve_3.2 code and compile the mex library code.
From the markov_games/ directory:

tar -zxvf lp_solve_3.2
cd lp_solve_3.2
make
cd ../lpmex
$MATLABDIR/bin/mex -O -v lpmex.c -I../lp_solve_3.2 ../lp_solve_3.2/liblpk.a -ll -lm

note: to do this on Brown dept machines, just do: mex -O -v lpmex.c -I../lp_solve_3.2 ../lp_solve_3.2/liblpk.a -ll -lm


-------------- Running Experiments --------------
Please see the matlab source for details:
runExp.m - training program
runTest.m - run in test mode
klog - various command for view data and models


=== TRAINING mode ===
The following will train a CCe (egalitarian) CEQ/grid game 1 experiment for 200k 
iterations and return the saved model in a file.  The file name is stored in
the 'outputName' list.

[t,g,outputName] = runExp("grid1","CCe", 200000, 3, 1, 1, 0.9, 0, 1,"long");

=== TEST mode ===
The following matlab code will initialize the data structure (loadExp), load a saved 
model from a previous test run, and run in testing phase for 10000 iterations.  
loadExp; 
load("experiments/grid/grid1-CCr-200000-NG-alpha1-eps1.mat");
runTest(simul,10000, 3, "grid1");
